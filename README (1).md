# Quiz-Application-Using-Java

A Quiz Application is an interactive program that allows users to take quizzes on various topics. Using Java in NetBeans, you can create a simple or advanced quiz application with features such as multiple-choice questions, timer functionality, scoring, and question navigation.

This application involves creating a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for displaying questions, capturing user input, and showing results. The project uses Java Swing for the GUI and basic file handling or a database for storing questions and answers.

#Step-by-Step Process to Create a Quiz Application

1. Set up NetBeans IDE
Download and install NetBeans IDE.
Set up the Java Development Kit (JDK) and link it with NetBeans.

2. Create a New Java Project
Open NetBeans and go to File > New Project.
Select Java with Ant > Java Application, then click Next.
Name your project (e.g., "QuizApp") and specify the project location.
Ensure "Create Main Class" is checked and click Finish.

3. Design the GUI
Use Java Swing to create a user-friendly interface.
Right-click the project and select New > JFrame Form. Name it QuizGUI.
Open the Design tab to drag and drop GUI components:
  JLabel: For displaying questions and quiz title.
  JRadioButton: For multiple-choice answers.
  JButton: For navigation (Next, Previous, Submit).
  JPanel: To group and organize components.
  JTextField (optional): To accept user input for open-ended questions.

4. Add Components to the Frame
Add a JLabel at the top to display the quiz title (e.g., "General Knowledge Quiz").
Use a JLabel to show questions dynamically.
Add four JRadioButton components for multiple-choice answers. Use a ButtonGroup to group them.
Add JButton components:
 Next: Load the next question.
 Previous: Navigate to the previous question.
 Submit: End the quiz and calculate the score.
Include a JLabel for showing a timer (optional).

5. Write Java Code
Right-click on the QuizGUI file and select Source to begin coding.

6. Test the Application
Press F6 or click the Run button in NetBeans.
Test the quiz flow, ensure navigation works, and validate answers.

7. Package the Application
Right-click the project and select Clean and Build.
Locate the .jar file in the dist folder of the project directory.
Share the .jar file to distribute your quiz application.
